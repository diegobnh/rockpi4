This document is meant to explain how to use this data collection tool, made for a processor using
the arm A53 and A72 cores in a 4 little 2 big configuration, respectively.


These are the assumptions that this tool makes:

1. Application directories (ADs) are the direct subdirectories of the apps directory. These 
   subdirectories will contain all of the files related to a single application.

2. Each AD will contain four specific subdirectories named bin, pmcs, dataset, and outlier_dir

3. The bin subdirectory, within each AD, must only contain uniquely named executables with the
   following format:
			*_*n#b#

   where '*' can be any character except '_'  and '#' must be a number. The number to the right 
   of 'n' is the number of threads this application is to be run on, and the number to the right of 
   'b' is the number of big cores to be used. The range of big cores is 0, 1, or 2. The range of threads
   is 2, 4, 6.
   
   Note: There can be no file extension on the binaries within the bin subdirectory 

Warning: A custom script may be necessary to conform your specific benchmarks to these assumptions.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


This is the command to run for the data collection of one application:

cd data_collection
sudo ./collect_data <AD name> <number of outlier loop iterations>

Note: The second argument is just a maximum number of iterations.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


After running the above commands, the pmcs subdirectory will contain many subdirectories; one for
each binary. These subdirectories will have all of the individual csv files and execution times,
prior to dataset creation.

The datasets subdirectory will contain the actual datasets (in csv file format) that are generated
from the raw data in the pmcs subdirectory.

The outliers_dir subdirectory will contain the record of the fix_outliers_loop.sh script, for 
each iteration of the loop.

   Note: A subdirectory called good_outlier_dir will be created in the event that something in 
         the recollection process went wrong. This holds all of the original outlier records,
         created here in the step above.


Warning: Make sure that all binaries in every bin directory have execution permissions.
	 Run: 
		find ./ -name bin -type d
		cd into all of the resulting directories 
		chmod 755 ./*
